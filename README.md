### Hi my name is Haraldur

I'm a computer science student currently in my third year at Reykjavik University.

Feel free to check out my projects on Github and explore my work.


I have hands-on experience in several programming languages, including
  - Python: 
    First language I learned at RU.
    I have worked with it in a few courses and developed my skills through various coursework and projects.

  - Java: 
    I have acquired experience through an Algorithms course where I used Java to complete various projects.
   
  - Javascript:
    I first learned Javascript in a web development course at Reykjavik University, but have since expanded my skills through practical courses such as app development.
    
  - C/C++:
    Last semester I finshed courses in Operating Systems and Programming in C++, which helped me to further develop my skills and knowledge in these languages.
    

Other technologies I have worked with include Django, React Native, and PostgreSQL.
