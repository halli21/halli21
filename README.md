### Hi my name is Haraldur

I'm a computer science student currently in my second year at Reykjavik University.

Here are some programming languages I have worked with:
  - Python: 
    First language I learned at RU and I have worked with it in a few courses. 
    Through many projects and assignments I feel very good about my abilities to debug and write efficient code.
